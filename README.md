# Design Patterns
 ## First Design Pattern (MVC)
  The whole appliaction is based on (MVC) design pattern so the application contains three folders (Models, Views, Controllers)
 
 ## Second Design Pattern (Singletone)
  This design pattern is used to create only one object from the class
  I used this design pattern in (config.php) in order to get only one object from Database connection object
 
 ## Third Design Pattern (Strategy)
  This design is used to allow you to select function during runtime
  This mean that each subclass implements parent class and implement function that in parent class as needed with different implementation
  I used this design pattern in (Users.php and userController.php) to make two methods for admin layer login { can login with username and    password or login with email and password }
